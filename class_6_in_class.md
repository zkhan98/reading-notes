# Javascript 
## In class notes
  - has two sides: client side and server side
  - client side -> means what the user sees and does and interacts with
  - variable -> it's a label for information (let x = 10)
      - Changeable
      - You declare a variable 
      - const x
      - let y
      - var z (outdated) try not to use
